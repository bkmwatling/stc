# Data structures and algorithms in C

This repository contains useful data structures written in C to allow for easy
reuse.

## Structure of repository

The `main` branch of this repository contains all the source code (data
structures, algorithms and tests), but there is another branch which just
contains the data structures and algorithms source code for easy reuse (through
something like git submodules). If you are interested in only using specific
data structures or algorithms, there will be a branch for each data structure or
algorithm for easy checkout.

Each data structure or algorithm has its source code in a directory named after
it in the root of the repository.
